crash, crashes 
Well, it never crashes on our system. It must have something\n
to do with your system. Tell me more about your configuration.

slow 
I think this has to do with your hardware. Upgrading your processor\n
should solve all performance problems. Have you got a problem with\n
our software?

performance 
Performance was quite adequate in all our tests. Are you running\n
any other processes in the background?

bug, buggy 
Well, you know, all software has some bugs. But our software engineers\n
are working very hard to fix them. Can you describe the problem a bit\n
further?

windows 
This is a known bug to do with the Windows operating system. Please\n
report it to Microsoft. There is nothing we can do about this.

macintosh 
This is a known bug to do with the Mac operating system. Please\n
report it to Apple. There is nothing we can do about this.

expensive 
The cost of our product is quite competitive. Have you looked around\n
and really compared our features?

installation 
The installation is really quite straight forward. We have tons of\n
wizards that do all the work for you. Have you read the installation\n
instructions?

memory 
If you read the system requirements carefully, you will see that the\n
specified memory requirements are 1.5 giga byte. You really should\n
upgrade your memory. Anything else you want to know?

linux 
We take Linux support very seriously. But there are some problems.\n
Most have to do with incompatible glibc versions. Can you be a bit\n
more precise?

bluej 
Ahhh, BlueJ, yes. We tried to buy out those guys long ago, but\n
they simply won't sell... Stubborn people they are. Nothing we can\n
do about it, I'm afraid.
